        <h2>1.Hiring additional outside third-party companies is beneficial: </h2>
        <p> Managers need to hire some professional help to get their customers acquainted <br>
             with the things that they need to be prepared for before joining in on one of the <br>
             tours that Ghost Tours offers. Managers are not an expert on everything, and some outside<br>
             insights will be best opportunity to help increase the business and improve their ratings with customers.<br>
             They need to satisfy all their customers, including the unhappy ones. According to the Mind Tools Content Team,<br>
              once you hear that your customers are unhappy, you adjust your mindset, get into the customer service mindset, <br>
              and solve the issue or issues that your customer is having. When talking to the customer about their problem or problems,<br>
             repeat their concerns back to them as you are actively listening to what they are saying and present them with a solution to the problem. <br>
             Managers are to immediately act on the problem that occurred. Once they have fixed the problem with the customer,<br>
             they will need to do a follow-up with them and make sure that their needs are met.</p>
        <h3>2.How to handle work arguments between employees: </h3>   
        <p> One of the severe potential consequences of not handling the situation<br>
            appropriately is customers overhearing the entire fight between the Owner <br>
            and their partner with the desk attendant. This could cause customers to not<br>
             want to come back the next time because of how the attendant did not handle<br>
              the issue appropriately. According to Erin Hueffner with Zendesk, when approaching<br>
             a customer situation where an argument has occurred, you should approach the situation<br>
             with empathy if other people could not want to intervene into the situation and make it worse.<br>
              Customers could start leaving when the argument is fully heard by everyone which will cause<br>
             loss of business and loss of profits. Customers could start to be so outraged by the situation<br>
             and not come back again and write bad reviews of the company which will cause even more loss <br>
             in profits and loss of potential future customers and business. This situation has<br>
             differently derailed customer satisfaction expectations and will cause a lot of <br>
             controversies about how the business runs, causing more loss of business and so on.<br>
              In all, a lot of loss of profits, business, and customer satisfaction could be lost <br>
             if the situation is not handled correctly right away. </p> 
        <h4>3.	How Managers should approach their employees with things that they need to do to improve profits:</h4>
        <p>Managers are doing what they are supposed to be doing as a manager but could approach the employee a <br>
           little differently about the situation. The manager should tell the employee exactly what they is doing<br>
            wrong and tell her how she could fix it. According to Indeed for employers, employers should keep a <br>
             positive perspective when talking to their employees, keep a record of their bad behaviors, and <br>
             remain professional when talking with their employees. I would recommend to the manager that they <br>
              follow these steps that Indeed recommends. Yes, the employee will still behave the way that she is,<br>
             but at least he will have a record of it and the potential to fire her if it needs to be. The manager<br>
             should remain calm and professional when telling the employee that their tips sales are low. These<br>
             are the things I recommend to managers do to keep themselves in an acceptable position with all their employees.</p>
        <h5>4.	How to handle reservations at restaurants:</h5>  
        <p>Reservations are something that can be a huge hassle for restaurants to handle so they do not offer them,<br>
             but those that do should have solutions in place to help guide restaurants people capacity. According to TouchBistro,<br>
              restaurants can place time limits on reserved tables, do not reserve all your tables and implement On-Waiting-List reservations.<br>
             I believe that the best solution to this issue is to have all restaurants except reservations, but limit how many<br>
             they take in a day and limit the amount of people that can be in a reservation. Another solution would be to not<br>
             to except big parties of people for tables and only expect parties of like 12-15 people max. This will help<br>
              restaurants manage the amount of people that can be seated at a time and make things be an easier flow in the<br>
             restaurants for employees to manage. Another solution would be to limit the number of people that are waiting<br>
             in the waiting area to be seated so that the restaurants do not get overcrowded and start pissing off<br>
             customers and employees. All these things will help ensure that hosts can get a better grip off how <br>
             to manage reservations at their restaurants and keep customers from getting to pissed off for not being <br>
              able to be seated when they want to be seated.</p>
